Clinical Trial Recruitment Smart Contract
📌 Description

This Move smart contract provides a simple framework for managing clinical trial recruitment on the Aptos blockchain.

Trial sponsors can create a trial with a target number of participants.

Patients can enroll in the trial until the recruitment target is met.

It ensures transparency, immutability, and trust in clinical trial recruitment processes.

🌍 Vision

The vision of this project is to decentralize clinical trial recruitment, ensuring fair participation and verifiable enrollment records. By leveraging blockchain, sponsors and patients gain confidence that enrollment numbers cannot be manipulated.

🚀 Future Scope

Add view functions for checking enrollment status and trial details.

Allow multiple trials per sponsor instead of one per account.

Integrate token-based incentives for participants.

Build a frontend DApp for patients and sponsors to interact with trials easily.

Add role-based access control (e.g., only authorized sponsors can create trials).
